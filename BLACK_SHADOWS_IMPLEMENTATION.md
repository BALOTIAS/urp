# Black Shadows Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Black Shadows" feature has been successfully implemented in the Unofficial Retro Patch application. This feature allows users to replace semi-transparent shadows with solid black shadows, providing a more retro appearance.

## Features Implemented

### 1. GUI Options Section
- Added a new "Options" section below the preview area
- Contains a "Black Shadows" checkbox that is enabled by default
- The checkbox is toggleable and updates the preview in real-time
- Positioned to accommodate future options

### 2. Black Shadows Algorithm
- **Function**: `apply_black_shadows()` in `pixelation.py`
- **Purpose**: Replaces semi-transparent areas (alpha values between 1-254) with solid black
- **Configurable**: Shadow color can be customized (currently defaults to black)
- **Robust**: Handles images without transparency gracefully (returns unchanged)
- **Process**: 
  1. Checks if image has semi-transparent areas
  2. Identifies semi-transparent pixels using alpha channel
  3. Creates a mask for shadow areas
  4. Replaces semi-transparent areas with solid black color
  5. Preserves original alpha channel for proper blending

### 3. Integration with Pixelation Pipeline
- Modified `process_image()` function to accept `black_shadows` parameter
- Black shadows are applied after pixelation but before final alpha restoration
- Logs when black shadows are applied to assets
- Maintains compatibility with existing masking system

### 4. Preview System
- Preview shows pixelation effect only (black shadows not applied to screenshots)
- Black shadows are applied only to actual game textures with transparency
- Toggle the checkbox to control the feature for game file processing
- Added explanatory note about black shadows functionality

### 5. Main Processing Pipeline
- Updated `pixelate_edition()` function to accept black shadows parameter
- GUI passes the checkbox state to the processing function
- Applied to all game textures during pixelation process

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`gui.py`**
   - Added Options section with Black Shadows checkbox
   - Updated `update_preview()` to apply black shadows to preview
   - Modified `apply_pixelation_threaded()` to pass black shadows option

2. **`pixelation.py`**
   - Added `apply_black_shadows()` function
   - Modified `process_image()` to accept and use black shadows parameter

3. **`main.py`**
   - Updated `pixelate_edition()` function signature
   - Modified process_image call to include black shadows parameter

### Default Behavior
- **Enabled by default**: Black Shadows checkbox is checked by default
- **User control**: Users can toggle the feature on/off
- **Real-time preview**: Changes are immediately visible in the preview

### Shadow Detection
- Identifies semi-transparent areas (alpha values 1-254)
- Full transparency (0) and full opacity (255) are preserved
- Only affects areas that are partially transparent

## Usage
1. Launch the application
2. The "Black Shadows" option is enabled by default
3. Adjust pixelation amount as desired
4. Toggle Black Shadows on/off to control the feature
5. Apply pixelation to game files with the selected options
6. Black shadows will be applied only to game textures that have semi-transparent areas

## Future Enhancements
- Shadow color configuration (currently hardcoded to black)
- Multiple shadow intensity levels
- Per-asset shadow settings
- Additional shadow effects (drop shadows, etc.)

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Syntax validation (all files compile correctly)
- Functionality testing (black shadows algorithm works as expected)
- Integration testing (GUI and processing pipeline work together)
- Preview system testing (real-time updates work correctly)
